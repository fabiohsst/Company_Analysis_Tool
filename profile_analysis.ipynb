It brought me back to when I first launched Fair Supply in Australia‚Äîequal parts exhilaration and trepidation. Back then, I called it being \"excitrifyed,\" and while I think the term still fits I have never been more convicted that supply chain transparency is critical for business resilience.\n",

      "on how to expand to LatAm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interesting to know that, from his British perspective, we couldn`t agree more on the first 2 tips:\n",
      "\n",
      "1- Markets are DIFFERENT within LatAm, profoundly different. In terms of size, level of maturity, way of doing business, governance and of course, culture and language. The landscape is a mosaic of landscapes, so pls do your homework. \n",
      "By the way, the vast majority fail on doing a good on-the-ground research. Don't be that person.\n",
      "\n",
      "2- Building relationships is key to thrive in LatAm, and I really mean it. Latins will do business when sharing a coffee or a pint in a decompressed environment, always. We believe that this is the way we truly know people. \n",
      "Every lunch time is an opportunity!\n",
      "\n",
      "My 2 cents:\n",
      "- Take into account that LatAm is still an underserved market in terms of PE/VC, for various reasons. That contributes to a much more friendly environment whenever doing business with non-locals. Tons and tons of low-hanging-fruits opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as always, pls DM if you want to share a cup of tea or coffee in London about opportunities in LatAm. Spreading the word is our core at\n",

      "\n",
      "I had a great opportunity to join a private group led by Steven Selikoff for an unforgettable experience in China. Having read his book, The COMPLETE BOOK of Product Design, Development, Manufacturing, and Sales, I thought I knew what to expect. But walking through the massive halls of the Canton Fair with Steven in person‚Äîseeing his insights and strategies in action‚Äîwas on a whole different level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every moment was a learning experience, with Steven sharing the kind of knowledge that only comes from years of hands-on work with both Chinese manufacturers and US retailers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We toured factories together, seeing production processes up close, with Steven guiding us through the complexities of manufacturing. A tour to Guangzhou Port also gave us insight into logistics, revealing just how critical every step is from factory floor to market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond these practical skills, Steven taught us the art of negotiation, showing us how to secure better terms with suppliers. He also introduced us to key contacts‚ÄîIP lawyers, inspection companies, labs, and logistics experts‚Äîwho are essential to making international business run smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steven‚Äôs teachings didn‚Äôt stop with China, either. We were taught about US retail trade, where Steven broke down what it takes to succeed in the American market. From understanding what US retailers want to navigating their standards and building strong partnerships, this knowledge was invaluable for anyone aiming to expand internationally.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps the best part was the incredible people I met in the group. It was inspiring to be surrounded by other driven entrepreneurs, each of us learning and building connections that might last a lifetime.\n",

      "Have most governments made the right call? No. Have plenty of politicians argued hard for more action - yes. Have some countries and people made an enormous difference - yes. Costa Rica reforested half the country. Finland is showing the way in good policy for people and planet. Does the media generally ignore them in favour of those who behave badly and are perhaps more compelling to watch? Yes. It is disappointing that hugely courageous politicians are lumped together with those that have prioritised short term thinking. I would make an urgent call to citizens, commentators, journalists to empower, follow, and be supportive but critical friends to those in decision-making positions that actually have the wellbeing of current and future generations in mind. They are out there.\n",

      "\n",
      "For this article, I thought it would be interesting to go back through the archives to see how the risks were viewed back in the day.  I was aware of a New York Times editorial called \"The CO2 Gamble\" from July 1979 but I wanted to see what others were saying.  I dug up a remarkable compendium of papers from a conference held in 1980 that covers a wide range of policy issues related to the then nascent threat.  The link is in today's piece.\n",

      "Anyway, the debate has progressed in many ways and regressed in others.  I get the feeling that the decades long disinformation campaign by climate deniers has degraded the discussion quite a bit.  You don't realize that this is the case until you take a ride in the de Lorean.\n",

      "Data is powerful, and the ability to access it quickly and accurately is important. In this course, instructor James Parkin helps you use your existing Excel skills to master the basics of working with data in SQL, one of the most common languages for database wrangling. James shows you how to set up your environment for SQL and shares some differences between spreadsheets and databases. He steps through SQL basics that you need to know to access and identify the data you need. In both Excel and SQL, you work with functions. James covers several, including SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT. He explains different methods of sorting, grouping, and organizing your data in SQL. James concludes by showing you how to use joins, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and XLOOKUP to combine your data.\n",
