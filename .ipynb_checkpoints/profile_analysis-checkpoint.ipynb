Certain entities, as required by the Corporations Act, must now report sustainability metrics in line with the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) S2 standard.\\n\\nThe reporting requirements mandate the disclosure of specific metrics and targets, including scenario analysis and scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions reporting. The GHG Protocol, the global standard for greenhouse gas accounting, categorises emissions into three scopes:\\n\\n𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲 𝟭: Direct emissions from company operations (e.g., company vehicles)\\n𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲 𝟮: Indirect emissions from purchased energy (e.g., electricity, heating, cooling)\\n𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲 𝟯: Emissions across the entire value chain, both upstream (e.g., purchased goods, transportation) and downstream (e.g., product use, waste disposal). These emissions often account for 70-90% of a company’s total carbon footprint and are the most complex to calculate.\\nBusinesses must disclose scope 1 and 2 emissions in their first year of reporting, with scope 3 emissions required from their second year.\\nJoin us for Climate Summer School on 27-28 February 2025 to learn:\\n\\n✅ How to calculate Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions\\n✅ Conduct scenario analysis to assess climate resilience\\n✅ Create compliance-ready reports aligned with Australian standards\\n\\nSave 20% with code 𝗘𝗔𝗥𝗟𝗬𝗕𝗜𝗥𝗗𝟮𝟬 before 17 January 2025! \\n\\n𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲:\\nhttps://lnkd.in/gY5KTfb5\\n14\\nLike\\nComment\\nShare\\nFair Supply\\n4,208 followers\\n1mo\\nReport this post\\nDon\\'t miss out...

      "We’re incredibly excited to be partnering with Canadian businesses as they navigate the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act. It’s a privilege to support organisations committed to driving transparency in their supply chains.\n",

      "Walking the streets of Canada these past two weeks, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of déjà vu. It brought me back to when I first launched Fair Supply in Australia—equal parts exhilaration and trepidation. Back then, I called it being \"excitrifyed,\" and while I think the term still fits I have never been more convicted that supply chain transparency is critical for business resilience.\n",

      "on how to expand to LatAm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interesting to know that, from his British perspective, we couldn`t agree more on the first 2 tips:\n",
      "\n",
      "1- Markets are DIFFERENT within LatAm, profoundly different. In terms of size, level of maturity, way of doing business, governance and of course, culture and language. The landscape is a mosaic of landscapes, so pls do your homework. \n",
      "By the way, the vast majority fail on doing a good on-the-ground research. Don't be that person.\n",
      "\n",
      "2- Building relationships is key to thrive in LatAm, and I really mean it. Latins will do business when sharing a coffee or a pint in a decompressed environment, always. We believe that this is the way we truly know people. \n",
      "Every lunch time is an opportunity!\n",
      "\n",
      "My 2 cents:\n",
      "- Take into account that LatAm is still an underserved market in terms of PE/VC, for various reasons. That contributes to a much more friendly environment whenever doing business with non-locals. Tons and tons of low-hanging-fruits opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as always, pls DM if you want to share a cup of tea or coffee in London about opportunities in LatAm. Spreading the word is our core at\n",

      "\n",
      "I had a great opportunity to join a private group led by Steven Selikoff for an unforgettable experience in China. Having read his book, The COMPLETE BOOK of Product Design, Development, Manufacturing, and Sales, I thought I knew what to expect. But walking through the massive halls of the Canton Fair with Steven in person—seeing his insights and strategies in action—was on a whole different level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every moment was a learning experience, with Steven sharing the kind of knowledge that only comes from years of hands-on work with both Chinese manufacturers and US retailers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We toured factories together, seeing production processes up close, with Steven guiding us through the complexities of manufacturing. A tour to Guangzhou Port also gave us insight into logistics, revealing just how critical every step is from factory floor to market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond these practical skills, Steven taught us the art of negotiation, showing us how to secure better terms with suppliers. He also introduced us to key contacts—IP lawyers, inspection companies, labs, and logistics experts—who are essential to making international business run smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steven’s teachings didn’t stop with China, either. We were taught about US retail trade, where Steven broke down what it takes to succeed in the American market. From understanding what US retailers want to navigating their standards and building strong partnerships, this knowledge was invaluable for anyone aiming to expand internationally.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps the best part was the incredible people I met in the group. It was inspiring to be surrounded by other driven entrepreneurs, each of us learning and building connections that might last a lifetime.\n",

      "Have most governments made the right call? No. Have plenty of politicians argued hard for more action - yes. Have some countries and people made an enormous difference - yes. Costa Rica reforested half the country. Finland is showing the way in good policy for people and planet. Does the media generally ignore them in favour of those who behave badly and are perhaps more compelling to watch? Yes. It is disappointing that hugely courageous politicians are lumped together with those that have prioritised short term thinking. I would make an urgent call to citizens, commentators, journalists to empower, follow, and be supportive but critical friends to those in decision-making positions that actually have the wellbeing of current and future generations in mind. They are out there.\n",

      "The debate about climate risk has been going on for a long, long time.  Climate scientists have understood the link between CO2 emissions and warming since the 1960s and people have been discussing the possible ramifications for almost as long.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For this article, I thought it would be interesting to go back through the archives to see how the risks were viewed back in the day.  I was aware of a New York Times editorial called \"The CO2 Gamble\" from July 1979 but I wanted to see what others were saying.  I dug up a remarkable compendium of papers from a conference held in 1980 that covers a wide range of policy issues related to the then nascent threat.  The link is in today's piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, the debate has progressed in many ways and regressed in others.  I get the feeling that the decades long disinformation campaign by climate deniers has degraded the discussion quite a bit.  You don't realize that this is the case until you take a ride in the de Lorean.\n",

      "We submitted a 40-year real-world study on heat mitigation in a desert climate to Nature Climate Change. The result? Desk rejected. Their reasoning: they were “not persuaded that our findings here are specifically relevant enough to climate change and its impacts to fit the scope of the journal.” (We have the letter to prove it, though disclosure is prohibited by the journal.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, speculative articles like the recent commentary in Nature boldly claim—without caution—that “humid heat exceeds human tolerance and causes mass casualties.” Their “evidence”? 1,300 deaths among unprotected individuals—83% of whom were undocumented pilgrims—with no demographic or clinical data provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isn’t walking unprotected in a desert during peak summer heat life-threatening regardless of climate change—especially without water, shade, or health safeguards? Yet somehow, these speculative studies, lacking context or solutions, pass peer review.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make matters worse, some of the authors of this speculation are members of the Lancet Countdown and IPCC, with frequent appearances in high-profile media outlets. They exert enormous influence over public opinion and climate policy—and yet, where is the accountability for the narratives they push?\n",
      "1. A few decision-makers dictate what counts as “serious” research while ignoring those living at the frontlines of the climate crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Why are alarmist, Western-centric narratives amplified, while evidence from the Global South is dismissed?   \n",
      "\n",
      "3. They claim there’s a “lack of data” from non-western countries, yet reject field-tested studies that show how communities survive extreme heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Do we need to create separate reports and narratives to ensure our findings are heard—while the planet desperately needs unity? Isn’t fighting denialism hard enough without being excluded from within?\n",

      "Our data shows that wet-bulb temperatures in our region rose by 0.2 °C  per decade—exceeding global averages—while targeted interventions significantly lowered heat-related mortality.\n",

      "Data professionals should choose the most effective and efficient tool for the task at hand. In some cases Python may be the right fit while R would be terrible in getting the job done, and in other cases the opposite may be true. Additionally, these coding languages are the most in-demand and essential, not only in data professions but also in several other tech fields. In this course Megan Lieu covers the use cases, pros and cons, and similarities and differences between using Python, R, and SQL in data projects. Megan covers the fundamentals you need to know for each language, shares real-world applications and examples for each, and shows you some case studies to show how you can use Python, R, and SQL to build your own projects.\n",

      "Excel, R, and Power BI are applications universally used in data science and across businesses and organizations around the world. If you’ve spent any time trying to figure out how to better model your data to get useful insights from it that you can act upon, you’ve most likely encountered these applications. In this course, Helen Wall shows how to use Excel, R, and Power BI for logistic regression in order to model data to predict the classification labels like detecting fraud or medical trial successes. Helen walks through several examples of logistic regression. She shows how to use Excel to tangibly calculate the regression model, then use R for more intensive calculations and visualizations. She then illustrates how to use Power BI to integrate the capabilities of Excel calculations and R in a scalable, sharable model.\n",
