      "\n",
      "Lucy Mort is no exception – as the co-founder and CEO of Sunroom, a consumer app that provides a space for women to earn money by creating content and connecting with their communities, Lucy has used product and design to create a space that feels unique, and caters to their specific community. \n",
      "\n",
      "Building a product that can sometimes confuse people (wait - I can only talk on Wednesday?!), I loved these product design insights from Lucy’s interview with Natasha Gillezeau:\n",
      "\n",
      "📈 Most Advanced, Yet Acceptable: Pioneered by Raymond Loewy, product design should be innovative, whilst accessible and familiar. In essence, as advanced as your target customer is willing to accept. The iPhone is a great example of this, providing incremental changes over time, whilst maintaining enough of the previous design so that it is familiar.\n",
      "\n",
      "⬇ Less is More: Build on the assumption that your users have no idea what your product is. The more features, the more complexity, the greater the barrier to adoption. Strip things back, listen to your users and your metrics, find your 1-2 key features driving value and stickiness and double down.\n",
      "\n",
      "👌 Selective perfectionism: Work smarter. Some features will require significant A/B testing and iterating and others won’t. Have a framework to understand the demand, value and ROI you are creating to guide what will move the dial and where to invest your time.\n",

      "At the Launch Vic Awards Nights, there was a lot of talk about the VC’s in our ecosystem, and quite a bit of mention of Angel Syndicates, but no mention of Venture Studios. In fact when people ask me what I do, I often have to explain what a Venture Studio is.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let me make the Venture Studio pitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, what is a Venture Studio?\n",
      "\n",
      "Venture Studios give life to startups in two main ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ideas are incubated and validated within the Venture Studio, once validated, the team finds the external resources/ people needed to bring the idea to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. External founders brings ideas to Venture Studios, in which the Venture Studio provides services and resources to the founder in exchange for equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "So who is a Venture Studio good for?\n",
      "\n",
      "High Quality Founders, with scalable ideas:\n",
      "The success of a Venture Studio relies on the success of the startups they work with so naturally Venture Studios are looking for the highest quality founders / startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early stage founders who are missing a technical partner: \n",
      "During the early days of your startup, if you don’t have a technical partner, you generally require investment or you need to take significant financial risk to fund your MVP build. While most investors won’t want to invest until you have a functional MVP, this is the exact stage many Venture Studio’s like to play in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why choose a Venture Studio over a development agency?\n",
      "\n",
      "Your developers will have skin in the game\n",
      "The app development process often goes wrong, because building apps is hard. If things go wrong, it’s easy for relationships to sour, and shortcuts to be made. Since Venture Studio’s success is so heavily tied into the success of their startups, by choosing a Venture Studio you have the peace of mind that your developers are so heavily incentivised to deliver an awesome product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Support beyond development\n",
      "Again because the success of the Venture Studios are so heavily tied to the success of the startup, it’s in the our best interest to ensure you are supported beyond your product build. So when it comes to GTM, capital raising and beyond, we aim to provide support and introductions where we.\n",
      "\n",
      "De-risk your financial position\n",
      "So this is the obvious benefit, get to launch without paying or paying a lot less. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of this is not to say, VC’s, Angel’s, Dev Shops all don’t play an important role in this ecosystem, I just feel the Venture Studio voice needs to be heard a bit louder.\n",

      "In Australia, AFL is more than a sport - it’s a religion. We even have a public holiday dedicated to the grand final! As a growing superannuation fund, we know we have a lot to learn from how AFL clubs deeply engage with their members. We’re looking forward to opportunities to integrate Superhero’s message of financial empowerment into the clubs’ engagement strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a relatively young company, a big investment in ‘brand marketing’ always feels risky - particularly when digital marketing channels are tried and true. But John Winters and I started Superhero because we’re driven by a mission to increase Australians’ engagement with their financial futures, and to offer them more choice on their superannuation.\n",

      "Why GP Carry Economics for Syndicates are Superior to Venture Funds\n",
      "\n",
      "Sharing #2 of 5 learnings Zachary Ginsburg posted via Last Money In Media yesterday on reflecting back after 500 SPVs completed. \n",
      "\n",
      "500 SPVs is not a typo :)\n",
      "\n",
      "–\n",
      "“The carry economics are arguably far superior for Syndicate GPs than the carry economics for fund GPs. \n",
      "\n",
      "We previously put out an article discussing the economics of venture, and the reality is that while venture can be the best performing major asset class the returns are skewed to the top funds with the average fund barely returning 1x capital back. There is no major asset class that has dispersion of returns quite as high as venture capital. \n",
      "\n",
      "This underscores the benefits for Syndicate GPs. For one, it means the time to actually receive carry income can be extremely quickly. Despite starting Calm Ventures in 2020, we had one nice exit in 2021 (~10x outcome in 12 months). While the returns from that investment were only ~10% of the capital deployed to that point, we still received carry (over a half million dollars). In a traditional fund if you returned only ~10% of capital back, you would not be seeing a dollar in carry from that sale. \n",
      "\n",
      "To further underscore the GP benefit, as mentioned, around half of funds return <1x DPI. Meaning half of GPs aren’t seeing a dollar in carry from their funds. You can have a <1x fund in SPVs and still receive an enormous amount of carry distributions. \n",
      "\n",
      "To take the extreme case, let’s say we invest $1M each into 100 investments via SPVs over the course of 3 years - so $100M invested total. 99 of those investments go to zero and one 100x’s or returns $100M. While LPs in aggregate didn’t make any money (we received $100M in distributions and invested $100M), the GP actually makes almost $20M dollars (20% carry x $99M in returns on the single performing investment). \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s worth pointing out that while the carry economics are superior, the fee economics are substantially worse for Syndicate GPs, who often aren’t drawing any consistent income or salary.”\n",

      "There's a limited number of venture capital firms with over 300 companies in the portfolio, and of those, an even more limited number who have over 3,000 investors making up a large and diverse network of Kiwis (around the world) who want to back New Zealand startups. These days, we also have a nice mix of financial institutions, KiwSaver funds, family offices and other institutional investors backing our larger flagship funds. \n",
      "\n",
      "This week we caught up as a team to hear directly from our investors (large and small) and from our startups (new and old) on what we can do better. There's definitely some homework for our humble tech team and much to my relief, most of the feedback on investor reporting and founder network effects lined up nicely with our product roadmap. We'll be rolling out some big changes to the platform coming soon to improve the investor, founder and startup operator experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favourite insight was that the more time a founder or investor spends with us (and with the wider network), the more they like us. So good things will continue to happen from more time in the market and from bringing people together. \n",
      "\n",
      "This week was a good reminder of how privileged we are to do truly world-class work from a remote island in the middle of nowhere, with world-class founders, world-class investors and a team who cook a mean taco.\n",

Certain entities, as required by the Corporations Act, must now report sustainability metrics in line with the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) S2 standard.\\n\\nThe reporting requirements mandate the disclosure of specific metrics and targets, including scenario analysis and scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions reporting. The GHG Protocol, the global standard for greenhouse gas accounting, categorises emissions into three scopes:\\n\\n𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲 𝟭: Direct emissions from company operations (e.g., company vehicles)\\n𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲 𝟮: Indirect emissions from purchased energy (e.g., electricity, heating, cooling)\\n𝗦𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲 𝟯: Emissions across the entire value chain, both upstream (e.g., purchased goods, transportation) and downstream (e.g., product use, waste disposal). These emissions often account for 70-90% of a company’s total carbon footprint and are the most complex to calculate.\\nBusinesses must disclose scope 1 and 2 emissions in their first year of reporting, with scope 3 emissions required from their second year.\\nJoin us for Climate Summer School on 27-28 February 2025 to learn:\\n\\n✅ How to calculate Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions\\n✅ Conduct scenario analysis to assess climate resilience\\n✅ Create compliance-ready reports aligned with Australian standards\\n\\nSave 20% with code 𝗘𝗔𝗥𝗟𝗬𝗕𝗜𝗥𝗗𝟮𝟬 before 17 January 2025! \\n\\n𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲:\\nhttps://lnkd.in/gY5KTfb5\\n14\\nLike\\nComment\\nShare\\nFair Supply\\n4,202 followers\\n1mo\\nReport this post\\nDon\\'t miss out...
