# Company Analysis with GenAI

This project automates the extraction and analysis of company data to generate structured insights. Using **BeautifulSoup**, it scrapes information from a company’s website or LinkedIn page, which is then processed by a **Large Language Model (LLM)**—such as **GPT-4o-mini**—to produce a **comprehensive company analysis**.

Originally, I designed this tool to streamline my **job search**, helping me understand a company’s core business, values, and workplace culture to determine if it aligns with my career goals. However, it can also be adapted for **other purposes**, such as identifying potential **business partnerships**.

### **Key Insights Generated:**
The final report includes critical aspects such as:
- **Company Background**  
- **Mission & Values**  
- **Leadership & Key Figures**  
- **Workplace Culture**  
- **Job Opportunities**  
- **Insights for Job Seekers & Business Partners**  

These categories are customizable, allowing users to **tailor the analysis** based on their specific needs. Whether you're researching potential employers or exploring partnership opportunities, this tool provides an **efficient way to gain deep insights** into a company.
