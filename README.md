## 📊 Company Analysis with GenAI

This project automates the extraction and analysis of company data to generate structured insights. Using **BeautifulSoup**, it scrapes information from a company’s website or LinkedIn page, which is then processed by a **Large Language Model (LLM)**—such as GPT-4o-mini—to produce a comprehensive company analysis.

Originally, I designed this tool to streamline my job search, helping me understand a company’s core business, values, and workplace culture to determine if it aligns with my career goals. However, it can also be adapted for other purposes, such as identifying potential business partnerships.

### Key Insights Generated
The final report includes critical aspects such as:
- **Company Background**
- **Mission & Values**
- **Leadership & Key Figures**
- **Workplace Culture**
- **Job Opportunities**
- **Insights for Job Seekers & Business Partners**

These categories are customizable, allowing users to tailor the analysis based on their specific needs. Whether you're researching potential employers or exploring partnership opportunities, this tool provides an efficient way to gain deep insights into a company.
